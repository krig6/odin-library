# Project: Library

## Overview

This project creates a simple library management system using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can add books by filling out a form, mark them as read or not read with a checkbox, and remove books from the library. The interface provides basic styling and functionality, suitable for expanding with additional features in the future.

## Learning Path

This project is a big step forward in my journey through The Odin Project. It focuses on using JavaScript classes, which were both challenging and rewarding. As I worked with this project, I found new ways to solve problems and had moments where everything clickedâ€”like when I figured out what was causing an issue or had ideas for improving the project. It's exciting to know there's always more to learn and explore in this journey.

## Future Enhancements

- Storing books in the cloud
- Organizing books by sorting
- Deleting multiple books at once
- Editing book details
- Animated interactions for a more engaging user experience
- Enhancing design responsiveness across all devices
